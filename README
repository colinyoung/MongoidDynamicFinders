Mongoid::DynamicFinders
=======================

This is a nasty hack that allows you to fake out dynamic finders even though Mongoid doesn't support them.

This library currently provides:

  Mongoid::FindBy         - include this if you just need find_by_(attr)
  Mongoid::FindOrCreateBy - include this if you only use 
			    find_or_create_by_(attr)
  Mongoid::DynamicFinders - includes both of the above.

This module meets my projects minimum requirements.  You may need more (like find_by_name_and_underpants_size).  Fork & tickle me.

Example
=======

class Person # app/models/person.rb
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::FindBy

  field :name, :type => String
end

class Preference
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::DynamicFinders

  field :name, :type => String
end

Person.find_by_name('James')
=> #<Person _id: 4c8e9bbe3716b709ba000001, name: "James">
Preference.find_or_create_by_name('black, no sugar.')
=> #<Preference _id: 4c8ea3723716b70b3a000001, name: "black, no sugar">
